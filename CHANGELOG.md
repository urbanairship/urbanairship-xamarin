# Urban Airship SDK

This component provides official bindings to the Urban Airship SDK, as well as sample applications for both iOS and Android.

### Release Notes

Version 9 - May 18, 2018
=============================
- Updated iOS SDK to 9.1.0
- Updated Android SDK to 9.2.0.

Note: Android SDK version 9.1.0 introduced support for FCM apis, modular packages, and in-app message design updates. More Android-specific details are available in the [changelog](https://github.com/urbanairship/android-library/blob/9.1.0/CHANGELOG.md). For FCM migration, please follow the [FCM Migration Guide](https://github.com/urbanairship/xamarin-component/blob/master/documentation/migration/migration-guide-fcm.md).

Changes
-------
- Split urbanairship package into iOS and Android packages. Also moved Android push providers into their own packages. `urbanairship` has been split into:

   - `urbanairship.ios` (iOS)
   - `urbanairship.ios.appextensions` (iOS Notification Service Extension)
   - `urbanairship.android.core` (Android core functionality)
   - `urbanairship.android.adm`  (Android ADM Push Provider)
   - `urbanairship.android.fcm`  (Android FCM Push Provider)
   - `urbanairship.android.gcm`  (Android GCM Push Provider)
- Starting with Version 9 of the Xamarin SDK, the version of the native bindings will track the native SDK version contained in that binding. The cross-platform libraries will be independently versioned.

Package | Version
--- | ---
urbanairship.android.* | 9.2.0
urbanairship.ios.* | 9.1.0  
urbanairship.netstandard | 9.0.0
urbanairship.portable | 9.0.0

Version 5.0.2 - April 20, 2018
==============================
- Added a .NET 2.0 standard library package.

Version 5.0.1 - April 10, 2018
===============================
- Updated iOS SDK to 9.0.5, and Android SDK to 9.0.6.

Version 5.0.0 - March 27, 2018
==============================
- Updated iOS and Android SDKs to 9.0.4

Note: Aside from SDK interface changes between 8.x and 9.x, iOS bindings have also
changed in that they no longer implicitly convert methods into properties.
Notably, accessors such as `UAirship.Push` and `UAirship.NamedUser` are now methods,
e.g. `UAirship.Push()` and `UAirship.NamedUser()`. This more closely refelcts
the structure of the iOS SDK and will help to make bindings more stable moving forward.
