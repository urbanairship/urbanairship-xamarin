Note: Aside from SDK interface changes between 8.x and 9.x, iOS bindings have also
changed in that they no longer implicitly convert methods into properties.
Notably, accessors such as `UAirship.Push` and `UAirship.NamedUser` are now methods,
e.g. `UAirship.Push()` and `UAirship.NamedUser()`. This more closely refelcts
the structure of the iOS SDK and will help to make bindings more stable moving forward.
