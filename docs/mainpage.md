# AirshipBindings .NET Standard Library

The AirshipBindings .NET Standard library exposes a common subset of functionality between
the iOS and Android SDKs. This library is built against .NET 2.0, and can be used
within shared codebases (e.g., a Xamarin Forms app).

## Requirements
 - Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android
 - NetStandard 2.0 requires a minimum of Xamarin.iOS 10.14 and Xamarin.Android 8.0, respectively

## Resources:
 - [Getting started guide](http://docs.urbanairship.com/platform/xamarin.html)

## Setup
Use NuGet to install the urbanairship.netstandard package.
Detailed instructions can be found in the [Getting started guide](http://docs.urbanairship.com/platform/xamarin.html#installation).

A cross-platform sample app is provided in the `SampleApp` directory on
[Github](https://github.com/urbanairship/urbanairship-xamarin/tree/main/SampleApp).
